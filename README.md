# MUSIC-LIBRARY

Backend API and database for storing artist & album data. Both tables linked by artistId as a foreign key in Albums. Completed as part of the Command Shift Full Stack Bootcamp, March'23 cohort.


## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HollyJM81/music-library.git
```
```bash
npm install
```

Create .env and .env.test files
Enter your database's credentials in both (make sure PGDATABASE name in .env.test is different)

Double check that .env and .env.test are in .gitignore... ü•∑

```bash
npm start
```
    
## Tech Stack

Dev - Node, Nodemon, Express, Postgres-migrations, dotenv 
\
Testing - Mocha, Supertest, chai


## Running Tests

## Lessons Learned

This was an epic learning curve in routers and controllers - connecting to a database through an API and serving data back to a client. The success of the project hinges on using TDD to write the 4 major CRUD functions for both artists and albums.

This was my first time working with migrations (if you take a look at that directory, you'll see how long it took to get my head around postgres constraints...), mocha tests, separate routers and controllers, and express.

Biggest takeaway: don't make cut-and-paste Franken-code! It never works. Instead I really tried to be disciplined with zooming out to determine what functionality I actually needed, what resources I already had at my disposal, and where the gaps were in the logic. Huge thanks to my classmate Dal Bahia, who finished the project well ahead of everyone - I was grateful to have a) someone to chase, and b) a working codebase to compare to, when I hit a brickwall with updateAlbum and its associated test.

Finally, hurrah for Postman! It took me a while to feel fluent with it, as a tool, but in the end I found it super helpful for testing routes and API connectivity. Working directly in PGAdmin was also really useful to cofirm the right syntax for inline postgres queries.
